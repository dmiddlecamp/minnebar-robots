# on frustration

* stare into space, take a walk, go to sleep, you have more brain that just your conscious active mind, your subconscious will engage on interesting problems if you care about  
* do what you need to, in order to get it working, then keep improving it until you get to a local minimum, restart, repeat, etc.  Perfect is the enemy of good.

# on hacks

* how to solve a problem (in life / programming)
  * break a problem you cannot solve into smaller problems that you can solve.
  * study the problem until you know it well
  * understand the underlying assumptions
  * outline in pseudocode
  * explain the problem to an inanimate object
* find someone who knows more than you and ask for help


# on motivation

 In my experience, programming is one of the most frustrating things you may ever do.  Remember that your ability to work harder when frustrated, step back, think, and keep trying is often more important than talent. 

The experience of feeling that you are bad at something is very common while programming.

tl;dr; It’s okay to be frustrated so long as you keep going.
